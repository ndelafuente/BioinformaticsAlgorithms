GENG 430: Problem 2 â€“ Variables and Some Arithmetic

This program calculates takes two triangle side lengths a and b, and 
calculates the square of the hypotenuse (c^2)

Given: Two positive integers a and b, each less than 1000.

Return: The integer corresponding to the square of the hypotenuse
        of the right triangle whose legs have lengths a and b.
