GENG 430: Problem 3 â€“ Strings and Lists

This program calculates generates a two-word phrase based on a string
and two pairs of start and stop indices.

Given: A string s of length at most 200 letters and 4 integers a, b, c and d.

Return: The slice of this string from indices a through b and c through d
        (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should
        include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice.
