GENG 430: Problem 11 â€“ Counting Point Mutations

Given two strings s and t of equal length, the Hamming distance
between s and t, denoted dH(s,t), is the number of corresponding
symbols that differ in s and t. See Figure 2.

Given: Two DNA strings s and t of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).

Return: The Hamming distance dH(s,t).
