GENG 430: Problem 9 â€“ Complementing a Strand of DNA

In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other,
as are 'C' and 'G'.

The reverse complement of a DNA string s is the string s' formed by
reversing the symbols of s, then taking the complement of each symbol 
(e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").

Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.

Return: The reverse complement s' of s.
